[Paul Harvey](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/paulharvey/)
and [Colin Perkins](https://csperkins.org/) are organising the 
[Glasgow Research Standardisation Network](https://glasgow-rsn.github.io), a new
community of practice within the University of Glasgow, that aims to bring
together researchers and professionals from different areas to share
experience and support each other about the translation of research
outcomes to standards.
