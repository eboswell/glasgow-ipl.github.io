Ryo Yanagida from the group is involved in an inter-disciplenary project 
looking at the coding education in various disciplines and the impact of AI-tools
such as ChatGPT on students learning. 

Today, Ryo and his colleagues on this project hosted an event inviting other educators 
involved in teaching programming in a wide range of subjects to discuss the problems 
and potential solutions.

Elizabeth Boswell from the group attended as well, sharing insights from her experience 
through tutoring and marking in CS.
