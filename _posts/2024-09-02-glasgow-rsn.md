[Paul Harvey](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/paulharvey/)
and [Colin Perkins](https://csperkins.org/) are organising the 
[Glasgow Research Standardisation Network](https://glasgow-rsn.github.io),
a new community of practice within the University of Glasgow, that aims to
bring together researchers and professionals from different areas to share
experience and support each other about the translation of research
outcomes to standards.

The kick-off meeting took place today, starting to explore who in the
University is doing research that might lead to standardisation, and who
is studying the standardisation process itself, why such work matters to
individuals and to the University, and how we might organise to help
each other work more effectively.
